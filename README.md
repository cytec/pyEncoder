# pyEncoder

pyEncoder is a python script to automaticly convert/reconvert mediafiles to the iTunes Media Format (mp4).

Size and bitrate is easy adjustable.

I wrote it for my own purpose so there is only support for English and German Audio and no subtitles atm.

THIS IS STILL A VERRY ALPHA STATE THING, so use on your own risk
