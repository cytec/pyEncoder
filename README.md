# pyEncoder

pyEncoder is a python script to automaticly convert/reconvert mediafiles to the iTunes Media Format (mp4).

Size and bitrate is easy adjustable.

I wrote it for my own purpose so there is only support for English and German Audio and no subtitles atm.

THIS IS STILL A VERRY ALPHA STATE THING, so use on your own risk

**pyEncoder uses [ffmpeg](http://http://ffmpeg.org/) for encoding, [tvdb_api](https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api) for metadata, [mediainfo CLI](http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/de) for getting infos from video file, and [AtomicParsley](http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/) to set the iTunes metadatas**
